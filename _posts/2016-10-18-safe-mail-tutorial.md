An example of an email app skeleton to allow developers to pick it up and add some basic functionality for a fully working email MVP. Then add further functionality using the APIs described in this tutorial, to make amazing communication tools in SAFE. We have tried very hard to not make a user-facing app as we want developers to see this as a tutorial and know they have everything they need for communications apps in SAFE and a bit more.
