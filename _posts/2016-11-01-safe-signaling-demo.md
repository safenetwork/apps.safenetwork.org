The **SAFE Markdown Editor** lets you create and edit Markdown files. The files are encrypted using a symmetric key, which means that only you can read them. Each time you save a file, a new version is stored on the SAFE Network. You can browse through previous versions of your files and compare the difference across versions. This example demonstrates the usage of [versioned structured data](https://api.safedev.org/low-level-api/structured-data/).

**Live version**

You can access the **SAFE Markdown Editor** at **[safe://editor.safedev](safe://editor.safedev)** using [SAFE Browser v0.4.0-5](https://github.com/joshuef/beaker/releases/tag/v0.4.0-5).
